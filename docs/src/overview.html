We have defined an Ibis-API, which can be implemented by an
Ibis-implementation.  Every JVM may run multiple Ibis-implementations.
The user can specify the Ibis-implementation at startup.  An
Ibis-implementation offers certain PortType properties.  When creating
an Ibis-implementation, it can negotiate with the application to see
if it offers the required properties.  When creating an
Ibis-implementation, a global unique name must be specified for it by
the application.


<h2>Communication</h2>

Communication is based on ReceivePorts and SendPorts of a certain
PortType. A PortType can be created using the Ibis.createPortType
method, where a name is given to the PortType (e.g. "satin porttype"
or "RMI porttype"). Port properties are given to the PortType (for
example ports are "reliable" and support "Sun serialization").
For each PortType there is a ReceivePort and a SendPort. Only
ReceivePorts and SendPorts of the same PortType can communicate. Any
number of ReceivePorts and SendPorts can be created on a JVM (even of
the same PortType).
<BR><BR>

SendPorts and ReceivePorts are created by their PortType using the
'createSendPort' and 'createReceivePort' methods.
When creating an ReceivePort that must receive by means of upcalls,
it must be associated with an object that implements the
"Upcall" interface. Upcalls are generated when messages arrive.
The alternative is to use explicit receive to read messages.
<BR><BR>

The system provides a globally unique ReceivePortIdentifier and
SendPortIdentifier for every ReceivePort and SendPort. These identifiers
are implementation specific and serializable (and can be sent over the
network/saved in a file etc.).
When a ReceivePort is created its ReceivePortIdentifier will be stored
in a registry.  The application storing the ReceivePortIdentifier is
responsible for providing a globally unique name (key) that
identifies the ReceivePortIdentifier in the registry.
<BR><BR>

A SendPort takes the initiative to connect to or disconnect from
ReceivePorts (otherwise the one-way traffic scheme is violated).
A SendPort can be connected to one or more ReceivePorts using their
ReceivePortIdentifiers. These ReceivePortIdentifiers may be obtained
using the registry, by sending them over the network, or any other
way.  Additional ReceivePorts may be connected at any time.
A SendPort can be disconnected from one or more ReceivePorts using
their ReceivePortIdentifiers.  Additional ReceivePorts may be
disconnected at any time
When a SendPort is no longer used it must be freed 
using the 'close' method.  All connections the SendPort has are
disconnected.
When a ReceivePort is no longer used it must be freed using the 
'close' method.  This call will block until
connections to SendPorts are disconnected (by the SendPorts).
<BR><BR>
 
A message can be sent from an SendPort to the set of ReceivePorts it
is connected to.  To do this, a Message is obtained from the SendPort
(this allows streaming, as the destination is known).  Data can be
added to the message using "write" methods (this data may be
immediately streamed to the ReceivePorts).  The Message can be sent
using a 'finish' method. When the 'finish' returns all data has been
copied (it now may be changed) and the Message may no longer be used.
When the Message arrives at a ReceivePort, how it is handled depends on
whether an upcall handler was provided.
If an upcall handler was provided a "new" thread is started (upcall),
that runs the "upcall" method of the upcall handler.
When the Message is no longer used it MAY be returned to the
system using the 'finish' method (after which the message may no longer
be used).
If no upcall handler was provided, messages are delivered when the
"receive" method is called (explicit receipt).  When the Message is
no longer used it MUST be returned to the system using the 'finish'
method (after which the message may no longer be used).  This is
done to free possible resources in the underlying implementation,
and to allow for new messages, as only one message per Receiveport
can be active at any time.

<h2>Ordering of Communication</h2>

Messages may export a sequence number, which can be used to determine
their order.  When a PortType specifies that the communication is not
ordered, Message will be delivered in an undefined order.
When a PortType specifies that the communication is uses some order
messages will be delivered in that order.

<h2>Adding and Removing Implementations</h2>

when an Ibis implementation is added to the pool, all other
implementations will receive an upcall, providing them with the
user-specified unique name of the new implementation.  when an
Ibis-implementation wants to be removed from the pool, all other
implementations will receive an upcall, providing them with the
user-specified unique name of the implementation that wants to leave.

<h2>Rationale</h2>

With ReceivePorts and SendPorts we basically have a 'connection
oriented' message passing model, based on one-way connections (from
Sender to Receiver).

<h3>Why is this better than the TCP/IP model?</h3>

With our model we can support message passing (unicast and
multicast), and an RPC-style model (using two one-way connections).
TCP creates two-way connections and private channels, which is 
inappropriate for multicast.

<h3>Why is it better than UDP or Panda?</h3>

Our model is connection oriented: when a message is created the
destination is known. This allows the implementation to stream data
to the destination, even while the message is being built (allowing
a better bandwidth and memory utilization, and flow control with
complex data structures).

Our model allows messages to be sent to an object (instead of a
process). This is much better suited for the Java model (and SMP
machines).

Our model does not have a closed world assumption. JVMs may be 
added / removed during the computation.

<h3>In general:</h3>

Our model can be implemented efficiently, both on streams based 
(TCP/IP) systems and message passing systems. 

It allows the use of low-level optimizations such as hardware multicast 
(or LFC).

It is flexible because, using a properties mechanism, it allows 
the application to select and configure the provided primitives at runtime.

It is extensible, because, using a properties mechanism, new functionality 
can be exported by implementation, without changing the interface.
