The Satin package is designed for running divide-and-conquer programs
on distributed memory systems and grid computing systems.

Satin extends Java with two simple Cilk-like primitives for
divide-and-conquer programming.  The Satin byte-code rewriter and
runtime system cooperate to implement these primitives efficiently on
a distributed system, using work stealing to distribute the jobs.
