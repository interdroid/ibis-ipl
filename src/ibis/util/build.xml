	Compile natives in this directory

	Expect to inherit the following properties:
	    native.dir		the directory of this build
	    ibis		the root of the ibis source tree
	    native-path		${native.dir} relative to ${ibis}
	    build		the root of the ibis build tree
	    default.classpath	a ref property with default classpath

	The shared target definitions require you to define:
	    local.includes	a property that contains include paths specific
				to this module

	Optional:
	    local.lib		the truncated name of the lib you want to create
