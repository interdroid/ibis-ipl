Topic		Short explanation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Distribution	Bug reports and comments on the upcoming monolithic distibution.

Grun		Do we include grun in the distribution or make a 
		seperate release of grun?

run_ibis	run_ibis 0 2 pool 4566 fs0 Main (current)
		OR
		run_ibis 0 2 pool fs0:4566 Main
		OR
		run_ibis 0 2 -Dibis.pool=pool -Dibis.nameserver=fs0:4566 Main
		OR
		...

Binary distro	Do we want it? In what form? Timeframe?

IbisC		The Ibis Compiler. Alternative for building apps to ANT?
		Default build system for binary distro?

build.xml	The build system has a few problems:
		- slow^2 (due to recursive ant calls)
		- too verbose
		- apps building depends on whole tree
		- apps building depends on included ant
		- no "ant dist" => binairy-distro.tar.gz
		- no way of building entiry tree (including apps) from root
		- no support for automatic testing/benchmarking
