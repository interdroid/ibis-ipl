IBIS:

- code formatting of entire tree
- IPUtils: currently selects the Gigabit cards on fs2. There are two
  external IP addresses. Maybe in such a case see what you get
  through the "old" mechanism?
- Satin barnes_inline performance: why do we not get the same performance
  that Maik got in March 2004? (Ibis serialization, MP Ibis, NTC version of
  Barnes).
- investigate CvR's problem with an Ibis run involving 2 imacs/ibooks, a windows
  machine and a linux machine. It seems to hang (or compute forever) if the
  windows machine is added to the pool???
- IPL += sendPort.connect(ReceivePortIdentifier[] receivers);
    After distribution.


satin:
- add semantic analysis to the compiler
- forgotten sync statements
- make return / throw an implicit sync again?
- add comments to abort / inlet machinism
- als exception gegooid wordt zonder catch krijgen we nu aborts... / geen print bij top of the stack.


general:
- IBISC maken / fixen
    after distribution.
- run central nameserver on fs0
