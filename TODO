ipl:
- IPL += sendPort.connect(ReceivePortIdentifier[] receivers);
- add receiveports local to an ibis:
	- PortType.createReceivePort(..., ..., ..., boolean local); ??
	- Registry.lookupReceivePort(Ibis ibis, String name)
	
rmi:
- check Ibis RMI registry:
  - you don't have to actually start one;
  - registers url's, not names.

satin:
- add semantic analysis to the compiler
- forgotten sync statements
- make return / throw an implicit sync again?
- add comments to abort / inlet machinism
- detection of what is an inlet: now, if the invocation is inside a try-catch
  it is assumed to be an inlet. Is this OK?
- als exception gegooid wordt zonder catch krijgen we nu aborts... / geen print bij top of the stack.
- rob (na distro): check satin caches.
- shutdownhook -> System.exit

implementations:
- PandaIbis connection management broken (e.g. connectedTo())
  (who reported this? Please check if this is still actual ... I placed locks
   in them .... Ceriel) I did, I'll check :-) --Rob
- nameserver: should not be a daemon thread, but then, if it is not, shutdown
  hooks don't get executed. Rather, nameserver should be a separate process,
  not just a thread.

general:
- ibisc
- run central nameserver on fs0
- threadpool now fixed size, should be dynamic
