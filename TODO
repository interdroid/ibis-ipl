ipl:
- IPL += sendPort.connect(ReceivePortIdentifier[] receivers);
- inconsistent createIbis deprecated
- createReceivePort javadoc: 
	- anonymous receiveport possible by giving "null" as a name
	- uniqueness name not spefied
- "upcall" should be "messageupcall" wherever relevant (mostly in properties)
- add receiveports local to an ibis:
	- PortType.createReceivePort(..., ..., ..., boolean local); ??
	- Registry.lookupReceivePort(Ibis ibis, String name)
	
rmi:
- check Ibis RMI registry:
  - you don't have to actually start one;
  - registers url's, not names.

satin:
- add semantic analysis to the compiler
- forgotten sync statements
- make return / throw an implicit sync again?
- add comments to abort / inlet machinism
- als exception gegooid wordt zonder catch krijgen we nu aborts... / geen print bij top of the stack.
- rob (na distro): check satin caches.
- shutdownhook -> System.exit

implementations:
- ibisses use shutdown hooks (should only be done in runtime/ipl app)
- default serialization Ibis instead of Sun for all implementations
- sending from a never connected sendport should be possible
- PandaIbis connection management broken (e.g. connectedTo())


general:
- ibisc
- run central nameserver on fs0
- set log4j default log level to "warn" instead of "off"
- threadpool now fixed size, should be dynamic
- anonymous threadpool thread creation should not be allowed
- ant -> ant clean build
- put ccgrid paper on website
