IBIS:

- autodetect connection setup mechanism (splicing, reverse, direct, central)
  Ceriel: not so easy. Once you are trying to set up a brokered socket,
  both sides have to agree on what types to try, use timeouts to detect
  if a connection setup fails, ... AnyTCP comes close, but does not revert
  to RoutedMessages when TCPSplice fails. Difficulty is in detecting when
  TCPSplice fails, but it might be done with a timeout?
  Anyway, issue for after first distribution.
- code formatting of entire tree
- IPL += sendPort.connect(ReceivePortIdentifier[] receivers);
  After distribution.

satin:
- add semantic analysis to the compiler
- forgotten sync statements
- make return / throw an implicit sync again?
- add comments to abort / inlet machinism
- als exception gegooid wordt zonder catch krijgen we nu aborts... / geen print bij top of the stack.


general:
- IBISC maken / fixen
  after distribution.
+ include grun in distribution
- run central nameserver on fs0
