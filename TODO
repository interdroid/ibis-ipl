nameserver:
- we forget to close connections on errors, see for instance forwardJoin in NameServer.java --Rob
- remove pool if all nodes left/crashed? --Rob

general:
- I cannot add an "external" ibis that ibis does not know about without changing the
  properties file in the original tree. --Rob
- nameserver needs to know classes of all ibis identifiers. 
  Not really an option for external ibises --Rob

serialization selection:
- test program says: 
      serialization = sun 

  then when selecting the ibis implementation we get:  

    Looking for an Ibis with properties: 
    worldmodel = closed
 -> serialization = sun
    verbose = 
    communication = autoupcalls, onetoone, explicitreceipt, reliable
    name = tcp

  and when creating the port type we get:

    Creating port type test type with properties
 -> serialization = sun
    worldmodel = 
    verbose = 
    communication = autoupcalls, onetoone, explicitreceipt, reliable
    name = tcp

  But when I add "-Dibis.serialization=ibis" to the command line I get:

    Looking for an Ibis with properties: 
 -> serialization = ibis
    worldmodel = closed
    verbose = 
    communication = autoupcalls, onetoone, explicitreceipt, reliable
    name = tcp
 
  which seems ok, but the port type says: 

    Creating port type test type with properties
 -> serialization = sun
    worldmodel = 
    verbose = 
    communication = autoupcalls, onetoone, explicitreceipt, reliable
    name = tcp

  Is that right ?


ipl:
- IPL += sendPort.connect(ReceivePortIdentifier[] receivers);
- add receiveports local to an ibis:
	- PortType.createReceivePort(..., ..., ..., boolean local); ??
	- Registry.lookupReceivePort(Ibis ibis, String name)
- make classes in ipl abstract as much as possible

rmi:
- check Ibis RMI registry:
  - you don't have to actually start one;
  - registers url's, not names.
- BUGS in rmi stubs (& skeletons?) -> if there is an IOexception, messages are not finished! --Rob

satin:
- add semantic analysis to the compiler
- forgotten sync statements
- make return / throw an implicit sync again?
- add comments to abort / inlet machinism
- detection of what is an inlet: now, if the invocation is inside a try-catch
  it is assumed to be an inlet. Is this OK?
- als exception gegooid wordt zonder catch krijgen we nu aborts... / geen print bij top of the stack.
- rob (na distro): check satin caches.
- shutdownhook -> System.exit

implementations:
- PandaIbis connection management broken (e.g. connectedTo())
  (who reported this? Please check if this is still actual ... I placed locks
   in them .... Ceriel) I did, I'll check :-) --Rob
- NetIbis: 
    * fix performance issues in net.gm (e.g.  mpj+javagrande benchmarks)
    * make it possible to make ipl classes use abstract.
    * remove dependancy on "local" gm version in default set-up

connect stuff:
- Rob: Update manual and readme files to reflect new structure.
       But, first test it :-)
- Rob: allow user to load socket types per *connection* use the 
       property map for this

general:
- ibisc
- load ibisses dynamically from jar files (like JavaGAT)
- run central nameserver on fs0
- split up ibis.jar in multiple files (in a sane manner)
- use a $IBIS_HOME variable instead of explicit paths in build files of
  applications
- make javadoc available in a file for eclipse somehow
- move applications to a real tree

future:
- add out-of-band communication support to the Nameserver interface
