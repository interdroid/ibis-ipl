Before you try to configure Ibis, you must set the environment
variable JAVA_HOME; see also the system-specific notes at the end
of this text.

The Ibis software requires `ant', a software building tool similar to
`make', but written in Java, and well-suited for building Java software.
Many OS distributions contain `ant' as a standard or optional package,
otherwise, the latest version can be obtained from the ant website at
<http://ant.apache.org>.

Ibis requires at least version 1.6.0 of ant.

I. Configuration

I.1. Configuration without high-speed LAN

If you don't have a high-speed LAN for which you require an Ibis
module (like GM (Myrinet), MPI, or Panda) you have to do no configuration.

I.2. Configuration with high-speed LAN

If you do have a high-speed LAN for which you require an Ibis
module (like GM (Myrinet), MPI, or Panda), you must configure
Ibis by typing

ant configure

You will be asked for the path to a number of support libraries. If you
don't have one or more of these libraries, just type <ENTER>.
The configuration setup figures out which of the support libraries
actually exists. The Ibis build does not attempt to build the native
code for absent modules.

I.3. Changes to your configuration

If you want to change your configuration or want to set
parameters for the build process, the preferred way is to
change the generated file build-properties in the root Ibis
directory.
Changes are currently:
 - paths to support libraries;
 - switching on/off of java compiler optimization or debug symbol
   generation;
 - switching on/off of native compiler optimization or debug symbol
   generation;
 - native code compiler selection.

II. Build

Build by typing

ant

III. System-specific notes

MacOS X
=-=-=-=

Set the environment variable `JAVA_HOME' to `/Library/Java/Home'.

For native code generation, you are required to install the Java SDK.
