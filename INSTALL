Before you try to configure Ibis, you must set the environment
variable JAVA_HOME; see also the system-specific notes at the end
of this text.

The Ibis software requires `ant', a software building tool similar to
`make', but written in Java, and well-suited for building Java software.
Many OS distributions contain `ant' as a standard or optional package,
otherwise, the latest version can be obtained from the ant website at
<http://ant.apache.org>.

Ibis requires at least version 1.6.0 of ant.

To configure Ibis, type

ant configure

You will be asked for the path to a number of support libraries. If you
don't have these libraries, just type <ENTER>.

After Ibis has been configured, you can build it with

ant

Set the environment variable `JAVA_HOME' to `/Library/Java/Home'.
