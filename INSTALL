Before you try to configure Ibis, you must set the environment
variable JAVA_HOME; see also the system-specific notes at the end
of this text.

The Ibis software requires at least a 1.4 version of Java. With a
1.3 or older version of Java, some parts of Ibis will not compile.

The Ibis software requires `ant', a software building tool similar to
`make', but written in Java, and well-suited for building Java software.
The Ibis distribution requires you to use the `ant' that is supplied with
Ibis. This version of ant lives in 3rdparty/apache-ant-1.6.1/bin.
Below, when `ant' is mentioned, this version is intended.

A `compile' script is supplied which invokes this `ant' with the
arguments supplied.

I. Configuration

I.1. Configuration without high-speed LAN

If you don't have a high-speed LAN for which you require an Ibis
module (like GM (Myrinet), MPI, or Panda) you have to do no configuration.

I.2. Configuration with high-speed LAN

If you do have a high-speed LAN for which you require an Ibis
module (like GM (Myrinet), MPI, or Panda), you must configure
Ibis by typing

./compile configure

You will be asked for the path to a number of support libraries. If you
don't have one or more of these libraries, just type <ENTER>.
The configuration setup figures out which of the support libraries
actually exists. The Ibis build does not attempt to build the native
code for absent modules.

I.3. Changes to your configuration

If you want to change your configuration or want to set
parameters for the build process, the preferred way is to
change the generated file build-properties in the root Ibis
directory.
Changes are currently:
 - paths to support libraries;
 - switching on/off of java compiler optimization or debug symbol
   generation;
 - switching on/off of native compiler optimization or debug symbol
   generation;
 - native code compiler selection.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Build

Build by typing

./compile

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

III. API

The Ibis API documentation can be built by typing

./compile docs

This will build a "docs" directory with an "api" sub-directory.
Point your favorite HTML viewer to docs/api/index.html to view
the API documentation.
Note that the javadoc of the 1.4.1 version of Java may hang. In that
case, please use a newer version.

IV. System-specific notes

MacOS X
=-=-=-=

Set the environment variable `JAVA_HOME' to `/Library/Java/Home'.

For native code generation, you are required to install the Java SDK.
