Ibis can only be compiled with the ant that is provided in the Ant
distribution. Make sure this ant is the first in your search path
by issuing the command:

    which ant


Make sure that the environment variable ANT_HOME is not set, or
points to this Ant distribution.

In particular, the ant that is supplied in the MacOS software
distribution `fink' sets ANT_HOME to a value that causes trouble.
