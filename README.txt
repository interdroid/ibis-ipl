Ibis README

Ibis is an open source Java grid software project of the Computer Systems
group of the Computer Science department of the Faculty of
Sciences at the Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
The main goal of the Ibis project is to create an efficient Java-based
platform for grid computing.

This Ibis distribution contains the Ibis communication library (defined by the
Ibis Portability Layer (IPL)) and several implementations of this IPL.

Ibis is free software. See the file "LICENSE.txt" for copying permissions.

Installation instructions, including prerequisite software are contained
in the file "INSTALL.txt".

The programmer's manual in the docs directory ("docs/progman.pdf") contains
a detailed description of the Ibis Application Programmer's interface (API),
illustrated with example code fragments. It also explains how to
compile and run your Ibis application.
The javadoc of the API is available in "javadoc/index.html".
See INSTALL.txt for instructions on how to build these.

Ibis has its own web-site: http://www.cs.vu.nl/ibis/.
There, you can find more Ibis documentation, papers,
and example application sources. For the latter,
see http://www.cs.vu.nl/ibis/downloads.html.

The latest Ibis source repository tree is accessible through anonymous SVN
at "https://gforge.cs.vu.nl/svn/ibis/ibis/trunk". Likewise, the latest example
applications are available at "https://gforge.cs.vu.nl/svn/ibis/ipl-apps/trunk".
You need an account on https://gforge.cs.vu.nl/ to access the repositories
there. You can create an account by clicking the 'New Account' button
on the https://gforge.cs.vu.nl/ page.
To build these applications, you first need to set some environment
variables. See the README.txt file that accompanies the Ibis applications.

The file BUGS.txt contains information for filing bug reports.

This Ibis release includes grun, a tool to start jobs on a
Globus-based Grid. See "grun/docs/README" for more details.
The grun program itself lives in "grun/bin".

There is some dispute about the pronounciation of the word "Ibis". The
file "docs/rob.mp3" shows how one of the Ibis designers feels about this
issue.
