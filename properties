#
# This file lists the Ibis implementations, and their property files.
# The format is that described in de java.util.Properties#load(InputStream),
# with an implementation name as propertey key, and a list of property
# filenames as property value.
#
# The order in this file is not significant, because
# java.util.Properties#load(InputStream) is used to read it. Therefore,
# at the end, a property named "order" is given, which should give
# a "preference" order: fastest one first.
