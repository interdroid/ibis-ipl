Ibis installation

    Before you try to configure Ibis, you must set the environment
    variable JAVA_HOME; see also the system-specific notes at the end
    of this text.

    The Ibis software requires at least a 1.4 version of Java. With a
    1.3 or older version of Java, some parts of Ibis will not compile.
    Suitable versions of Java can be obtained from the web.
    IBM has versions for Linux and AIX
    (at http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java),
    SUN has versions for Solaris, Linux, and Windows (at http://java.sun.com), 
    and Apple has a version for Mac OS X (at http://developer.apple.com/java).

    The Ibis build process requires `ant', a software building tool similar to
    `make', but written in Java, and well-suited for building Java software.
    At least version 1.6.1 is required.

Configuration

Configuration without high-speed LAN

    If you don't have a high-speed LAN for which you require an Ibis
    module (like GM (Myrinet), MPI, or Panda) you have to do no configuration.

Configuration with high-speed LAN

    If you do have a high-speed LAN for which you require an Ibis
    module (like GM (Myrinet), MPI, or Panda), you must configure
    Ibis by typing "ant configure".

    You will be asked for the path to a number of support libraries. If you
    don't have one or more of these libraries, just hit "ENTER".
    The configuration setup figures out which of the support libraries
    actually exists. The Ibis build does not attempt to build the native
    code for absent modules.

Changes to your configuration

    If you want to change your configuration or want to set
    parameters for the build process, the preferred way is to
    change the generated file "build-properties" in the build-files
    directory.
    Changes are currently:
    - paths to support libraries;
    - switching on/off of native compiler optimization or debug symbol
      generation;
    - native code compiler selection.

Build

    Build by typing "ant".  Afterwards, you can run a simple test by
    running "ant test". Before running tests, however, you need to set the
    IBIS_HOME environment variable to the path where Ibis is installed.

API
    The Ibis API documentation can be built by typing "ant docs".
    This will build an "api" directory within the "docs" directory.
    Point your favorite HTML viewer to "docs/api/index.html" to view
    the API documentation.  Note that the javadoc of the 1.4.1 version of 
    Java may hang while building the API documentation.
    In that case, please use a newer Java version.

System-specific notes

Mac OS X

    Set the environment variable JAVA_HOME to "/Library/Java/Home".
    For native code generation, you are required to install the Java SDK.

Windows 2000, Windows XP

    Install a recent Java SDK, at least 1.4, and preferably 1.5, because
    1.4 seems to have some problems. This will get installed in
    for instance "c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0". You can set the
    JAVA_HOME environment variable to this path by going to the
    Control Panel, System, the "Advanced" tab, Environment variables,
    add it there and reboot your system.

Cygwin

    Set the environment variable JAVA_HOME to wherever it is installed
    on your windows system. You can do that as described above, or do
    it the "Unix" way. If you choose the Unix way, use quoting, so,
    for instance,

	export JAVA_HOME="/cygdrive/c/Program Files/Java/jdk1.5.0"

	or

	export JAVA_HOME="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0"
